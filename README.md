**Abstract** — Scheduling models for manufacturing systems play a significant role in the industry to optimize the work and workloads of a certain manufacturer. One approach to having an efficient system in production is by planning a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) because this optimizes scheduling for both dynamic and unpredictable conditions. With the existence of different scheduling algorithms, manufacturers utilized the best suited algorithm for their type of manufacturing. In this study, MATLAB Fuzzy Logic Toolbox, with the use of Graphical User Interface (GUI), is employed to identify the best routine to manufacture plain stainless steel Hex Bolts classified in different dimensions. The given input variables are the amount of required work, processing time, and the distance of a machine from each other. With the use of fuzzy logic, the results demonstrate the optimized routine/schedule of work among the possible selections.
